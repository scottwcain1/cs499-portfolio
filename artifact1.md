# Artifact 1 — Software Engineering Enhancement

## Overview
This artifact demonstrates my ability to improve the structure, readability, and maintainability of an existing software system. I selected a backend API service originally built earlier in the program and enhanced it by refactoring the codebase, improving modularity, and strengthening error handling.

## Why I Selected This Artifact
I chose this artifact because it represents my growth in software engineering practices. The original version worked, but it lacked organization, clear separation of concerns, and consistent coding standards. Enhancing this artifact allowed me to apply professional engineering principles and demonstrate my ability to transform functional code into maintainable, scalable code.

## What I Improved
- Refactored the project into a cleaner, modular folder structure  
- Improved naming conventions and code readability  
- Added centralized error handling  
- Strengthened input validation  
- Improved API responses for clarity and consistency  
- Updated documentation to reflect the improved architecture  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Software engineering and refactoring  
- Clean code practices  
- API design and backend development  
- Debugging and problem‑solving  
- Technical documentation
