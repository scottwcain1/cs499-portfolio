# Professional Self-Assessment

My academic journey through the Computer Science program has strengthened my technical abilities, sharpened my problem‑solving skills, and prepared me to contribute meaningfully as a software engineer. Throughout this program, I have developed and refined competencies in software design, algorithms, data structures, databases, security, and full‑stack development. These experiences have shaped my ability to think critically, build reliable systems, and approach challenges with a structured, engineering‑focused mindset.

## Software Design & Engineering
I have gained experience designing modular, maintainable, and scalable software. Through multiple projects, I learned how to break down complex problems, apply object‑oriented principles, and write clean, well‑structured code. My capstone enhancements demonstrate my ability to refactor legacy code, improve readability, and strengthen overall system architecture.

## Algorithms & Data Structures
The program reinforced the importance of efficiency and performance. I applied algorithmic thinking to optimize code, reduce complexity, and ensure that solutions were both correct and scalable. These skills helped me debug issues quickly and design more reliable systems.

## Databases & Full‑Stack Development
Working with both frontend and backend technologies allowed me to understand how data flows through an entire application. I built and improved RESTful APIs, implemented CRUD operations, and worked with MongoDB to store and manage data securely. This full‑stack experience helped me understand how to design systems that are both functional and user‑focused.

## Security & Best Practices
Security was a major focus throughout the program. I learned how to identify vulnerabilities, apply secure coding practices, and protect user data. These skills were applied directly in my capstone enhancements, where I improved authentication, validation, and error handling to create a safer and more resilient application.

## Professional Growth
Beyond technical skills, this program strengthened my communication, documentation, and project‑management abilities. I learned how to present my work clearly, justify design decisions, and collaborate effectively. These skills are essential for success in real‑world engineering environments.

## Capstone Overview
My capstone project brings together the knowledge and experience I gained throughout the program. I selected artifacts that demonstrate my strengths in software engineering, full‑stack development, and secure coding. Each enhancement showcases my ability to analyze existing code, identify weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements that increase functionality, performance, and maintainability.

This portfolio represents not only the work I completed, but the engineer I have become—capable, adaptable, and ready to contribute to the field of software development.
